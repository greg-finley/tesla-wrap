# Tesla Model Y Wrap Designer

This project is for designing vinyl wraps for a Tesla Model Y.

## Files

- `template.png` — flat-lay outline template of the Tesla Model Y showing all panels (roof, doors, fenders, bumpers, etc.)
- `colorize.py` — script to apply colors/fills to the template
- `outputs/` — completed wrap designs

## Panel Orientation Note

The template is a flat-lay top-down unfolded view. The left and right door/fender panels
are laid out horizontally in the image, but they are **vertical on the actual car**.

**Any artwork placed on the left panels must be rotated 90 degrees clockwise** so it
appears right-side-up when the wrap is applied to the car door. The same applies
(mirrored) for right panels.

Only work on left panels unless explicitly asked to touch middle or right panels.

## Outputs
